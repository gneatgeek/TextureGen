This shader project was developed using the GLman platform.
You can get this software from http://cs.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/glman/

This is my final project for CS 419-Shaders at Oregon State University.
The purpose of this set of shaders is to dynamically create textures for anywhere a texture might be used (web, photoshop, etc).
